Where to Begin
===============



SR&ED Overview
-----------------------

SR&ED stands for Scientific Research and Experimental Development.

Experimental Development
  Work undertaken to achieve technological advances for the purpose of creating new, or improving existing, materials, devices, products or processes, including incremental improvements.

Income Tax Act 248(1)
  Tax Incentive to stimulate Innovation in Canada 018: ~ $3.2 B delivered to 20,000 companies. Direct increase to your company’s bottom line The CRA is a customer: lets meet their needs too!

SR&ED Scope
  Architecture, Development, Testing & Analysis, and Project Management

SR&ED Criteria
1. technological uncertainty
1. what was so hard
1. results unpredictable
1. did not know the best technological approach.

Technological Content
1. What did you do?
1. A *systematic investigation* by qualified personnel.

![Note]Not trial and error.

Technological Advancement
1. what did you learn?
1. advance state of knowledge in a field of tech.
1. advance underlying technology
1. advance within the ‘context’ of your business

Supporting Documentation
--------------------------------

SR&ED Eligible Projects
1. projects that advance what's *under the hood*
1. design patterns – to gain more flexibility, efficiency, reliability, ease of maintenance.
1. languages, plug-ins, libraries, and protocols
1. significant extensions and different translators
1. applications software development
1. developing systems for particular uses
1. new combinations of known programming principles to overcome constraints
1. data, hardware, and application integration
1. algorithms to achieve significantly better operations
1. new object representation or data structures
1. any attempts at new approaches, new mechanisms, new architectures, development of tools, or
1. development of technology layers to enhance existing technologies at your company


![Note]Success is not a criteria: Failure is OK. You still learned something.

SR&ED Non-Eligible Projects
1. incremental addition of features and functions
1. configuration of existing hardware and software systems
1. software upgrade or maintenance
1. routine system development
1. does not go further than existing techniques and tools within capabilities
1. evaluating, buying, and configuring 3 rd party tools
1. refactoring/code optimization
1. fine tuning
1. debugging

How Do I Identify SR&ED
---------------------------------------


Focus on Constraints
1. risk
1. a project may be very valuable for our business: it may be novel, it may not exist on the market, etc...
1. but for SR&ED we must have a Technological Obstacle to overcome.


### SR&ED Constraints Technological Obstacle





Work Performed
1. collecting, storing, manipulating, and communicating data using systems
1. it is how the data is manipulated, organized or communicated, and whether the methodology represents an advance over common methods
1. determining that a technique, construct, methodology, will or will not work can constitute an advancement
1. advancements can occur in knowledge of new techniques, or understanding how best to use them, and which solutions, techniques, are appropriate for which purposes.
1. constraints and technological challenges are often due to the nature of the tools, which technologies are to be used, and/or the environment in which the component/library/framework is to be used.
1. often only your company’s developers can understand or explain this, not auditors, and support documentation is needed.



Software SR&ED Constraints
1. architectures (size, technology used)
1. inter-operability, integration, third party components
1. conformance to standards or legacy requirements
1. resources and services
1. performance (step response, throughput)
1. concurrency
1. footprint
1. scalability/portability
1. stability (MTBF)
1. system uncertainty
1. competing constraints/ non-deterministic environments
1. lack of insight to determine parameters of a *black-box*

Which Activities are Tracked?
1. SR&ED eligible activities
1. Direct supervision of SR&ED
1. Recording measurements/results
1. Preparing equipment, testing, and analyses (server setup, network setup) - Making calculations
1. Developing algorithms Experimenting and testing (software development) - Conducting statistical surveys and interviews
1. Design and software architecture
1. Software Engineering
1. Mathematical analysis
1. Software development


Eligible Support Activities
1. collecting data for analysis
1. analyzing test results, requirements
1. technological planning for SR&ED
1. assignment of technological personnel |---| testing
1. development of technological strategies |---| job priority technological documentation for internal use/ip (design/code/test specs, and the like.

Which Activities Are Not SR&ED
1. administrative training
1. collecting and analysing market data (marketing)
1. preparation of user manuals
1. routine uat/quality control
1. non SR&ED clerical and administrative support.

NOT incremental to SR&ED (Covered by Proxy Amount)
1. personnel support (hr)
1. accounting
1. maintenance
1. purchasing
1. it or finance leadership team.

How and Where Do We Track SR&ED Data
1. project plan progress reports
1. minutes of project
1. meetings
1. item of work
1. records of resources allocated to the project
1. timesheets test protocols
1. data
1. analysis of test
1. results
1. conclusions
1. Design of Experiments Photos and videos
1. records
1. notebooks
1. developer log book samples
1. prototypes
1. scrap and other artifacts
1. design specifications
1. system architecture and source code versions contracts
1. invoices
1. statement of work
1. records of trial runs others |---| e-mail, blog, wiki, and the like
1. forum/vendor/Stackoverflow posts
1. timesheets
1. JIRA,
1. Trello,
1. Slack tickets
1. Git commits,
1. source control versions
1. system/architecture design docs.

Item of Work
1. monthly with each technical lead
1. short-form capture of technical issues
1. is required to link the work performed to time tracking.


In Time Tracking
1. project code (general)
1. task code (not specific enough)
1. description of work done during task, related to removing constraints and issues.
1. link to obstacles.
1. can clearly define advancement.

Usual Claim Timeline Proactively During Year
1. identify SR&ED projects upfront (technological strategy)
1. identify SR&ED projects on-the-fly (PM/architects/developers)
1. R&D / issue meetings
1. log your hours so they can be claimed (All)
1. document SRED Items of Work and eligible activities (technical leads)
1. save some documentation regarding the issue reactively during year
1. SR&ED status meetings: quarterly
1. identify eligible work
1. assign key contact to
1. identify and prepare ‘item of work’ documents
1. year end
1. collect the saved SR&ED data
1. finalize reports
1. link costs
1. submit.
