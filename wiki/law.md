How the Law Interprets SR&ED
==========================================

As you go through the materials here,
you will soon come to the conclusion that a competant SR&ED submission is a work of precision.
The [T661](https://github.com/seenthattinker/Conceptinero/blob/master/images/t661-15e.pdf) is a submission that requires extreme precision.
You have to follow a formula. 

It's not a bad idea to know some of the case law.


![Attention] We recommend case law post 2015 because of the changes to SR&ED.

The database is here [Tax Court Rulings](https://decision.tcc-cci.gc.ca/tcc-cci/en/nav.do).

The page appears as follows.

![Attention] Nothing will give you a better understanding of the precision required for a SR&ED application than reading some recent judgements. Remember what you are responsible for *proving* a SR&ED claim.
