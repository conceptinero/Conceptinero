The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) put forward a transparent assessment process in 2012.
The *ambiguity* of the previous legislation created court challenges which forced the CRA to adapt.
The five question approach was further refined in 2015.
The CRA defined the process as five questions.
The five questions were designed to
You must articulate your technology,
your business journey,
and your management process so that the CRA sees the five questions answered clearly and concisely with *yes*.



The five question approach is crystallized in the technical description of the work and the support documentation you submit with it.


.. note:: The support documentation is any foundation documents, like an architecture blueprint, a functional specification, a technical specification, a GitHub workspace, or any other collaborative space designed, created, and maintained to support the technology for which you seek SR&ED tax credit. Active work spaces that track changes are ideal because they document the project.


For each technological uncertainty:

1.  Articulate the feature, program, or functionality you tried to implement.

3.  Articulate the characteristic or capability in the underlying technology that was the root cause of the problem.

4.  Explain why the solution to the root cause of the problem was not apparent to personnel familiar with the technology.

5.  Provide a detailed listing of: activities, including experimental development activities (raising a question, designing and executing an experiment, or collecting and analysing results), the support activities, performers, timeframe, and hours.

6.  Articulate new technological knowledge formed as a basis of the above experimental development process.
