How Do I Identify SR&ED
-----------------------

Focus on Constraints
    -  risk
    -  a project may be very valuable for our business: it may be novel,
       it may not exist on the market, etc...
    -  but for SR&ED we must have a Technological Obstacle to overcome.

SR&ED Constraints Technological Obstacle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Work Performed
    -  collecting, storing, manipulating, and communicating data using
       systems
    -  it is how the data is manipulated, organized or communicated, and
       whether the methodology represents an advance over common methods
    -  determining that a technique, construct, methodology, will or
       will not work can constitute an advancement
    -  advancements can occur in knowledge of new techniques, or
       understanding how best to use them, and which solutions,
       techniques, are appropriate for which purposes.
    -  constraints and technological challenges are often due to the
       nature of the tools, which technologies are to be used, and/or
       the environment in which the component/library/framework is to be
       used.
    -  often only your company’s developers can understand or explain
       this, not auditors, and support documentation is needed.

Software SR&ED Constraints
    -  architectures (size, technology used)
    -  inter-operability, integration, third party components
    -  conformance to standards or legacy requirements

SR&ED Software Eligibility Checklist
====================================

Authors
    Kevin Kelper, Bruce MacDonald

Version
    1.0

Date
    September 15, 2020

In order for your project to be eligible for SR&ED the development
activities you performed need to meet very specific eligibility
criteria.

We need to focus on those development activities that involved
*technological problems* where the *solution could not be found* by
following *routine* approaches, such as the the application of known,
conventional or standard programming solutions or techniques.

.. raw:: html

   <div class="admonition tip">

Even if you had no prior experience in a particular area — it was new to
us — but you applied appropriate *due diligence* and found a ready-made
solution, then it would not be eligible, even if you had a steep
learning curve.

.. raw:: html

   </div>

A good verification that your problem could not be solved through known
techniques is to prove that you searched through relevant forums online,
or contacted the software application's technical support and they
couldn't provide you with a solution.

.. raw:: html

   <div class="admonition note">

An email from Microsoft stating *Our software does not support the type
of activity you are trying to accomplish* is excellent evidence that
your activity is not routine, or, if searching through forums, you posts
from other developers with similar issues for which they reported no
solution could be found.

.. raw:: html

   </div>

SR&ED eligible solutions to these types of technological problems can
include analysis, simulation, prototyping, experimentation, testing, and
the like, to overcome uncertainties. They can also involve evaluating
alternative approaches — method A v. method B v. method C.

Determining SR&ED Eligible Activities
-------------------------------------

Below are some questions that can help you determine what activities in
your development process could be SR&ED eligible.

1. Did the project involve developing completely new theoretical
algorithms or methods? Did you stretch the *technological* envelope?
Were you attempting to achieve one or more performance specifications
that were beyond your existing capabilities: faster response time,
greater throughput, more concurrent users, or similar?

#. Were you seeking to achieve advancements at a *technological* level —
databases, interfaces, source code, algorithms, operating systems, or
similar — and not on a functional level, as in, the tasks the software
performed?

Did you have to overcome *constraints* or limitations:

-  Limited memory or CPU cache, requiring a constrained *footprint* for
   the code
-  Limited computing resources, for example, code had to run on a
   low-powered CPU
-  Limited physical size or form-factor that constrained your options
-  Response time, for example, the end-to-end computing time had to meet
   real-time targets
-  Concurrency, for example, system had to work for 10,000 concurrent
   users;
-  Scalability, for example, failed at 20 messages/second but needed to
   support 2000/sec
-  Stability and reliability requirements, for example, 99.99% uptime
-  Compatibility with legacy software or hardware
-  Interoperability under different operating systems, for example,
   Windows, Linux, or another.
-  Did you have to overcome *system-level uncertainties*,for example,
   challenges caused by attempting to make two or more independent
   modules function together in some novel way?
-  Did the creation of a new graphical user interface (GUI) pose any
   *unusual* technological or human-factors challenges, for example, you
   needed to have an interface that would improve operator speed by a
   factor of two?

.. raw:: html

   <div class="admonition note">

Developing a new or improved GUI is usually *not* eligible for SR&ED,
regardless of complexity.

.. raw:: html

   </div>

Describing the SR&ED Process
----------------------------

Once we identify the technological problems that you had to solve, we
need to describe the activities you performed in order to attempt to
solve those problems, even if they were unsuccessful.

Describing the unsuccessful attempts is critical to prove that the
problems you encountered could not be solved through known,
conventional, or standard programming solutions or techniques. We are
not only interested in the solution that finally fixed the problem, but
the failures that led you to discover a working solution.

During the development did you perform any of the below activities. If
so, these are the activities we need to describe in detail.

Not including routine feature extensions, normal debugging, or typical
quality control, did you perform any of the following activities:

1. Research into alternative solutions or approaches
2. Analysis, simulation, experimentation or prototyping
3. Development and testing of prototype software modules
4. Incremental system integration and testing
5. Testing on one platform before porting to the final target platform
6. Mock-ups of limited-sized systems or networks
7. Stress tests to simulate loads on the network
8. Systematic experimental probing of an inadequately specified
   interface
9. Field trials of *alpha* versions of the software, for example,
   pre-release versions.

As a result of these activities, did the software undergo iterative
design changes, followed by further analysis or experimentation until
all the obstacles were resolved (or the project was abandoned?

Documenting the SR&ED Process
-----------------------------

Above and beyond the project report that we will produce you need to be
able to prove that these activities were performed during the fiscal
year. Documentation can include notes, memos, emails, code revisions,
test results, time sheets, and things like this.

The Five Questions Approach
===========================

Authors
    Kevin Kelper, Bruce MacDonald

Version
    1.0

Date
    September 15, 2020

The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) put forward a transparent assessment
process in 2012. The *ambiguity* of the previous legislation created
court challenges which forced the CRA to adapt. The five question
approach was further refined in 2015. The CRA defined the process as
five questions. The five questions were designed to You must articulate
your technology, your business journey, and your management process so
that the CRA sees the five questions answered clearly and concisely with
*yes*.

The five question approach is crystallized in the technical description
of the work and the support documentation you submit with it.

.. raw:: html

   <div class="admonition note">

The support documentation is any foundation documents, like an
architecture blueprint, a functional specification, a technical
specification, a GitHub workspace, or any other collaborative space
designed, created, and maintained to support the technology for which
you seek SR&ED tax credit. Active work spaces that track changes are
ideal because they document the project.

.. raw:: html

   </div>

For each technological uncertainty:

1. Articulate the feature, program, or functionality you tried to
   implement.
2. Articulate the characteristic or capability in the underlying
   technology that was the root cause of the problem.
3. Explain why the solution to the root cause of the problem was not
   apparent to personnel familiar with the technology.
4. Provide a detailed listing of: activities, including experimental
   development activities (raising a question, designing and executing
   an experiment, or collecting and analysing results), the support
   activities, performers, timeframe, and hours.
5. Articulate new technological knowledge formed as a basis of the above
   experimental development process.

Time Tracking
=============

Authors
    Kevin Kelper, Bruce MacDonald

Version

Date
    September 15, 2020

There is never enough time in the day, especially when it comes to R&D.
Save some time and make your SR&ED claim process as smooth as possible
by implementing these four simple productivity hacks.

Automate Time Tracking as Much as Possible
------------------------------------------

We recommend tracking one hundred percent of your time. This doesn’t
have to be a monotonous process.

Set up your time tracking categories upfront and then let software tools
automate the rest. Here are some automated time tracking tools to try
out this year.

TimeCamp
    When switched to automatic mode, all of your time is tracked to
    tasks using certain keywords. It uploads your tasks and integrates
    nicely with systems such as Trello, BaseCamp and Asana.

Chrometa
    Automatic tracking that records time spent within all applications,
    documents, emails, and web pages. It also records time while you’re
    away and prompts you to make notes.

Desktime
    Automatically tracks your desktop time as productive, unproductive
    or neutral and enables you to see both individual and organization
    level analytics. If you’re still tracking time on spreadsheets and
    aren’t quite ready to automate that process.

Replicon
    Offers a number of cloud-based time tracking applications that are
    customizable to your organization’s needs. It’s also integrated with
    large payroll services such as Ceridian, ADP and SAP.

Toggl
    Looking for a minimal solution? Toggl is a free time tracking tool
    that helps you keep track of tasks and only requires one-click to
    start tracking. It also integrates with popular project management
    platforms such as BaseCamp, Asana and Trello.

Chime
    Free time tracking tool that easily lets you send updates to team
    members and measure ongoing progress. It integrates nicely with
    BamBam!, a task management tool.

Stop Discussing Project Details Over Email
------------------------------------------

It’s easy to get bogged down by email. It’s also very time consuming to
stay on top of organizing your email into folders and categories. Save
yourself the headache of having to dig through your inbox for
SR&ED-related communications and start recording notes in one central
location. Here are some useful tools to improve your project
communication efforts and keep those notes out of your inbox.

Slack
    Great, easy to use platform for team communication. You can organize
    conversations around one topic or project, which makes it easy to
    streamline documentation or do a quick keyword search. It also
    integrates with a number of tools such as Github, code reviewer Code
    Climate, and bug tracker Bugsnag, to name a few.

HipChat
    Another alternative chat platform that enables one to one chat or
    groups. There is also video calling, screen sharing and enhanced
    security.

Producteev
    Great platform that does real-time updates on projects and can help
    you manage your to-do lists.

Schedule Fifteen Minute Check-in Meetings in the Afternoon
----------------------------------------------------------

Research shows the most optimal time for meetings is three PM on
Tuesdays. It is still early in the week and leaves enough time to
accomplish deadlines and finish other tasks before the end of the week.
Want to streamline your project meetings even more? We recommend a
weekly standing-only meeting to discuss project challenges. Keep these
meetings to fifteen minutes to maintain everyone’s focus and make the
best use of your team’s time. Have someone record all of the notes
discussed and this will keep you on top of all of your documentation
needed to fully support your SR&ED claim. You can also implement the
small-group principle and only include those who have something to add.

Plan Your SR&ED Claim Backwards and Start Now
---------------------------------------------

You plan your project backwards, so why not apply the same approach to
your SR&ED claim? Set aside less an hour to meet with your SR&ED adviser
and plan out your claim from start to finish. Being proactive and
submitting your claim within the first six months of your fiscal year
end will guarantee your claim is processed by the CRA and returned
within 120 days. Be sure to review your current time tracking and
documentation methods with your SR&ED advisor. They can recommend tweaks
to your existing methods to ensure that your team’s documentation will
meet the CRA’s strict documentation standards. The goal of reviewing
this information is not to introduce brand new systems, but to expand on
your team’s existing efforts so that they can continue to focus on doing
what they do best and you can rest assured your documentation will
support your claim in case of a CRA review.

SR&ED Technical Audit Pointers
==============================

Authors
    Kevin Kelper, Bruce MacDonald

Version
    1.0

Date
    September 15, 2020

To help you be better prepared for an SR&ED audit by CRA, explain the
process, minimize surprises and to maximize your ability to defend your
claims, we strongly recommend you understand the process.

Who Conducts The Audit
----------------------

Technical audits are performed by a Research and Technology Advisor
(RTA) — usually highly trained and educated themselves. Most RTAs have
an engineering or science background, with private sector work
experience. The CRA tries to match your claim — based on the field of
science — with an RTA’s training and experience.

RTAs are often accompanied by a Financial Reviewer (FR). The RTA sets
the agenda and tone of the audit. The FR takes their cues from the RTA.

An RTA-in-training may also be accompanied by a more experienced RTA.

Audit Process
-------------

The audit process has been codified by CRA in a lengthy manual used by
all RTAs as of June 2010. This 166-page document is called `Claim Review
Manual for Research and Technology
Advisors <www.cra-arc.gc.ca/txcrdt/sred-rsde/pblctns/ntr-tchrvw-eng.html>`__.

.. raw:: html

   <div class="admonition tip">

An edited version is available for taxpayers.

.. raw:: html

   </div>

`The SR&ED Technical Review: A Guide for
Claimants <www.cra-arc.gc.ca/txcrdt/sred-rsde/pblctns/tchrvw-cmmnt-eng.html>`__.

RTAs are now required to follow this somewhat rigid process, leaving
little flexibility.

Before the Audit
----------------

Everyone from the company who plans to attend the audit must read the
project reports beforehand. Technical staff should be prepared to
briefly summarize, for each project, and in their own words, the
following things:

#. Technological Advancements (‘Lessons Learned’)
#. Technological Uncertainties
#. Systematic Experimental or Analytical Methodology

Organize the supporting documentation and have it handy in the meeting
room. Plan to have lunch brought in during the audit. Confirm the
schedule with auditor. Plan for an all-day meeting. Confirm the schedule
with auditor beforehand.

During the Audit — Preliminaries
--------------------------------

This is generally not a hostile process. Everyone should be relaxed,
friendly and confident.

Don’t give the auditor the impression that you have somewhere else to
be. Attendees must be prepared for a potentially lengthy meeting. Try
your best not to express impatience.

That being said, personnel may need to rotate in and out of the meeting
because of other commitments throughout the day. This is fine, so long
as the people answering technical questions are available when the
auditor needs them.

Assume that the auditor will be chairing the meeting. Let them set the
agenda, but you can let them know you have a presentation and tour
planned.

The auditor will very likely have an educational presentation regarding
the SR&ED program. He or she may go into *Teaching Mode* about R&D. This
is part of their job.

Have a brief presentation about your company ready to go. If the
corporate structure includes a foreign parent, be very clear that the
R&D activities you are claiming took place in Canada.

Introduce your technical staff. Emphasize their qualifications. Offer a
plant tour. Highlight any on-going R&D, for example, a product
development lab, or something like this.

If the auditor offers technical advice, even if it’s their first visit
to your site, accept it gracefully. They’re not telling you how to do
your job. They may simply be fascinated by the work you do.

When you reconvene, let the auditor dictate the next step.

During the Audit — Questions about Specific Projects or Costs
-------------------------------------------------------------

The RTA may wish to examine every project in detail, or they may wish to
focus on one or two projects. Occasionally, they will be satisfied with
the tour alone, but don’t depend on this.

.. raw:: html

   <div class="admonition tip">

Be prepared to defend every project.

.. raw:: html

   </div>

Listen carefully to what the auditor is asking. Your responses should be
short, sweet and on topic.

Take ownership of the reports. Use them as guides regarding advances,
uncertainties, and methodology.

.. raw:: html

   <div class="admonition tip">

These are your words. We’ve just summarized them.

.. raw:: html

   </div>

Be prepared to state the following in your own words for each project:

The Advancement
    For example, we were seeking to improve process efficiency and
    increase operator safety by eliminating airborne toxins.

The Uncertainties
    There was no clearly defined way of accomplishing this goal. First,
    there was no ready-made solution available. Second, a number of
    alternative paths had to be evaluated, for example, liquid vs.
    powder, barrier, vacuum. And lastly, even if we implemented any of
    these alternatives, the results weren’t guaranteed.

What Was Done/What Was Learned
    Liquids proved unfeasible. Built and tested a prototype barrier.
    Experimented with inlet sizes. Implemented a vacuum system. Designed
    a customized *de-clumper*. After all this, we failed to realize the
    goal because a full-scale test showed that efficiency actually
    decreased.

Emphasize analysis, experimentation, prototyping, testing, and new
knowledge gained — these are the elements of a qualifying SR&ED project.

Have a piece of supporting documentation in mind, so that if asked, you
can get to it quickly.

Use statements like *systematic investigation/experimentation*, but not
*trial and error*.

Don’t back down if the auditor challenges a project. Defend it politely.
Interject politely, respectfully to correct any inaccurate statement
made by the auditor.

Common Challenges and Defense Strategies
----------------------------------------

RTAs often want to disallow a project on the grounds that it was
*routine engineering*. The best defense is to demonstrate that the
challenges or uncertainties you faced, however slight, could not be
overcome using standard practice in your industry. By definition, if you
could not solve the problem through the application of standard methods,
but rather had to resort to experimentation or analysis, then you are
doing eligible SR&ED.

It is vital to present evidence that some form of experimentation or
analysis took place, for example, dated test results, emails, reports,
photos, videos, and things like this.

Another common challenge involves the scope of eligible SR&ED within a
larger R&D projects. SR&ED only starts after the First Uncertainty (FU)
is encountered. RTAs sometimes try to peg the FU as the point of *first
failure*, which often occurs well after an R&D project starts, and
therefore limits the amount of eligible costs. To counter this
challenge, you must do your best to establish the FU as early as
possible. Uncertainties likely existed from the outset. Try to provide
documentation in any form that supports this assertion, for example,
technology or literature surveys, previous failures, expert opinion, and
things like this.

RTAs may at first dismiss your arguments by making an incorrect
assumption that *this is common knowledge*. If so, correct this mistake.

RTAs sometimes question the technical qualifications of the people doing
the work, especially if senior management is being claimed. Anyone on
the claim must have played a technical role, either directly doing or
supervising the experimental work.

Similarly, the use of material and capital equipment — although these
are cost related issues — are sometimes challenged by the RTA.

SR&ED Support Activities
------------------------

Work with respect to support work, the eight categories listed in
paragraph do not constitute SR&ED on their own. However, if it is
commensurate with the needs and directly in support of basic research,
applied research, or experimental development work undertaken in Canada,
it falls within the meaning of SR&ED.

Support work must be the following: It must be commensurate with the
needs of the basic research, applied research, or experimental
development work undertaken in Canada. In other words, it must be
corresponding in the amount, size, extent, or duration of work that is
necessary to carry out basic research, applied research, or experimental
development work undertaken in Canada.

It must be directly in support of the basic research, applied research,
or experimental development work undertaken in Canada. That is to say,
the work was carried out specifically to perform the related basic
research, applied research, or experimental development work undertaken
in Canada.

It must be with respect to one of the eight categories of work listed
below:

-  engineering;
-  design;
-  operations research;
-  mathematical analysis;
-  computer programming;
-  data collection;
-  testing; or
-  psychological research.

Excluded Activities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The definition is broad-ranging, and it can apply to many different
types of businesses, but the law specifically excludes certain
activities from SR&ED tax incentives. Among the activities that don’t
qualify are:

-  market research you do before you start your project
-  promotions
-  social science research projects
-  humanities research projects
-  and style changes.

You also may not count routine tasks such as testing, quality control,
data collection, commercial production activities, or commercial use of
your new and improved products or ideas.

Additional Audit Pointers

    Emphasize and Avoid

Systematic approach — planned ahead of time, conducted by qualified
staff, trial and error, experimentation, analysis, testing, prototyping,
and the like.

Routing Software Development
----------------------------

Experimental Development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Things at the technological Level: - throughput - speed - response time
- technological risks & constraints - limited bandwidth - limited
computing power - repeatability - reliability - bug fixes - coding - and
engineering are actually support activities.

Things at the functional Level:

-  what the code does
-  Programmatic risk
-  business risk
-  marketing risk
-  t- - oo costly
-  too complicated
-  not enough time
-  advancement in functionality feature extensions.

The earliest possible moment when the uncertainty was recognized —
ideally from the outset of the project. The stoic engineer recognition
that not everything is SR&ED. Every single thing in the project was
SR&ED.

Conclusion
----------

1. Auditor should tell you his/her intention for each project before
   they leave, but with the new audit procedure and manual, this is not
   always the case.
2. All is not lost if auditor has a problem. They may just want
   additional supporting docs.
3. You should receive a written report within a couple of weeks.
4. If you believe the auditor has been truly unfair, there is an appeal
   process, although it should rarely come to that.

Common Misconceptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New product development, by itself, is always eligible.

No
    Not if achievable entirely through standard practice. Engineering,
    design and programming constitute SR&ED.

No
    Not unless they support eligible experimental development. Projects
    qualify if they’re time-consuming, costly, complex, or difficult.

No
    These things are irrelevant unless all three eligibility criteria
    are met. Uncertainties related to budget, scheduling, marketing, and
    the like, matter.

No
    Not unless they lead to at least one technological uncertainty,
    novelty, innovation or uniqueness — *first of its kind* — always
    demonstrates a technological advancement.

No
    Because these are not necessarily the outcome of experimental
    development.
