Technical Advancement
-----------------------------


Project Background
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What was the state of the common body of knowledge at the company in respect to the technology surrounding the obstacle at the start of the project? (include technical platform, and the improvement sought or achieved)

(Include all activities and due diligence (for example, literature search, technology review)

Was the overall approach undertaken for the purpose of achieving a scientific or a technological advancement? Explain.

.. note:: Advancements can occur in knowledge of new techniques, but also in our understanding how best to use them and which solutions, techniques, are appropriate for which purposes.

Activities
  Did the effort involve formulating hypotheses specifically aimed at reducing or eliminating that uncertainty? Explain.

Approaches
  Was the overall approach adopted consistent with a systematic investigation or search,
  including formulating and testing the hypotheses by experiment or analysis? Explain.

Iterations
  Was a record of the hypotheses tested and the results kept as the work progressed? Explain.

Outcome, Success, Failures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When describing work, focus on the following:

- Chronological Milestones of the process (initial design, different versions of prototype development, alpha testing, beta testing, black-box testing etc.)
- Barriers /challenges encountered and how they were solved (or not solved)
- What results were obtained? What conclusions were drawn? What happened next?


.. note:: Also identify/describe the work done by subcontractors, if subcontractors were used.

Include all activities:
initial designs,
experiments,
analysis,
data collection,
prototype design/testing/modification,
all testing,
small scale and large scale beta testing and their results,
re-work due to problems,
re-design,
and the like.

Provide dates by month if possible, for example, *the version was developed by June 2017*

Major Technological Obstacles
  Was there a scientific or a technological uncertain


Issues
  Explain the Specific constraints and technological challenges, they are often due to the specific nature of the product, which technologies are to be used, and/or the setting in which the software is to be used.

  What were the technical issues / challenges / limitations /constraints in this setting?
  Underline technology issues, not product functions and features.


.. tip::

   You need to express the specific constraints or technological barriers.

.. note::

   Use specific technical terminology.

Possible Constraints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Volume of data (Process more than 150 terabytes of data)
-  Footprint (Consume less than 100k of memory)
-  Scalability (Gracefully adapt to increase/decrease of load)
-  Response time (Requests performed within 100ms)
-  Concurrency (Handle 1,000 users simultaneously)
-  Synchronization (Synchronize with a sessionless system)
-  Stability (Mean Time Between Failure > 1 year)
-  Legacy & Compatibility Issues (Work seamlessly with legacy data model)
-  Open Source Tools and Plug-ins did not work as intended (Needed to develop new uses/extend capabilities.
